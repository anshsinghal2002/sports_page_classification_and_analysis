# sports_page_classification_and_analysis

I will be focusing my 'research' on the sports part of the concordy as I feel it is a great topic to explore when it comes to a resource like the concordy. It is reporting along the same lines, with certain deviation, and has gradual shifting patterns in terms of tones, choice of reporting etc, which can be analysed. It will also be relatively easier to extract just sports content as opposed to any other isolated topic given that all matters sports are condensed into one chunky sports page, all I have to do is identify those sports pages, and then begin inspecting them!

Created a tfidf classifier which can now pick up on whether or not an OCR scan of an arbitrary newspaper page is a sports' page or not with high precision but low recall. Used this to extract all the sports pages from my college's 120 year archive of frequent newspaper editions which is available publiclly. I then analyzed and visuailzed interesting data from the exclusively sports pages.
